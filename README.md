# password-generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is generate a password based on a series of criteria given by the user. The project did request to use prompts however for accessibility and for a overall better user experience I have gone with using a slider for the length of the password and checkboxes for the options as this proves to be a easier option and makes it so there can be no issues with any of the user input. On top of that I have also made it so the requirements need 2 options instead of 1 to make the password more secure and if not enough options are chosen then the text will turn red.

## Installation

In order to run this download the repo and open the index.html file and choose which options you want in your password and length then generate one.  Alternatively the code can be located at https://alexwalland1997.github.io/password-generator/ and you can view the console through inspect on their to see the results.

## Usage

To generate a password choose at least 2 of the options and the length you want the password to be then click generate password
